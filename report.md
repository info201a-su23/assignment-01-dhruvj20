![Gender Disparity in CS Degrees from 1970-2010](/CSDegreesByGender.jpg)

The graphic chronologically illustrates the percentages of CS bachelor's degrees awarded to men and women to highlight the disturbing increase in female underrepresentation in the field over time. 

As the graph progresses, the location of the line shows the percentage of male recipients and the percentage of female recipients is shown by the remaining space. 

The caption in the center accentuates the situational direness the graph shows because "37%" is positively equated with progress towards gender equality in CS (D'Ignazio and Klein, "The Power Chapter"). 

That means out of 54 CS bachelor's recipients, only 20 would be women, and that's severe underrepresentation during what's presented as the height of progress in this field.

*Data Feminism* argues (Block Quote):
> As “data analysts” (low-status number crunchers) have 
> become rebranded as “data scientists” (high status researchers), women are being pushed out in order to make 
> room for more highly valued and more highly compensated men (D'Ignazio and Klein, "The Power Chapter").
## Data Viz Biography ##
**1. Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

Catherine D'Ignazio, the author of *Data Feminism*, made the visualization, but the *American Association of University Women* collected the data depicted by the visualization, per the [*Figure Credits*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ftb0980j/release/1?readingCollection=0cd867ef) webpage of *Data Feminism* (D'Ignazio & Klein, "Figure Credits").

**2. When was it produced?**

Per the page citation on the [*Figure Credits*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ftb0980j/release/1?readingCollection=0cd867ef) webpage of *Data Feminism*, the text was published in 2020, so the graphic was most likely made before the text's publication (D'Ignazio & Klein, "Figure Credits"). 

However, the figure citation on the same page says the data was published by the previously-mentioned institution in 2015 (D'Ignazio & Klein, "Figure Credits"). 

Furthermore, the visualization only shows data from 1970-2010, so there's a chance the data was collected up until 2010 only (D'Ignazio & Klein, "The Power Chapter"). 

**3. Who is the audience for the visualization?**

The target audience should be high-level figures in the computer science industry/universities' college admissions office so they can adjust workplace and admissions practices to fix the underrepresentation of women in the computer science field and progress towards gender equality.

However, anyone reading *Data Feminism* can 

**4. How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

The interpretation the graphic is trying to convey is that computer science has long been a male-dominated field, with women being underrepresented and excluded from gaining traction within it. 

The evidence lies in the percentage of CS bachelor's degrees by gender through 4 of the last 5 decades (scope of the collected data in this visualization), where 37% of bachelor's degree recipients being women is highlighted as "closest...gender parity" (D'Ignazio & Klein, "The Power Chapter"). 

In my opinion, the word consequence carries a negative connotation, which isn't really what the graph is attempting to convey. The graph's target interpretation is that more needs to be done to fairly and equally represent women in CS. 

Furthermore, the trend in this graph could evoke questions about gender representation discrepancies in other fields and workplaces, especially in STEM. 

**5. How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

The data visualization uses the percentage trend line for male CS degrees to illustrate the systematic control men have had over the field for a very long time.  

Furthermore, this visualization, as noted in the caption, the "report treated gender as a binary", thus excluding CS degree recipients who identify as non-binary from the study (D'Ignazio & Klein, "The Power Chapter").

Chapter 4 covers the exclusion of non-binary people in society in depth, and more or less, what the data collectors chose to do by excluding people who identify as non-binary just illustrated the systematic exclusion they attemped to highlight in their data collection within the CS field (D'Ignazio & Klein, "The Power Chapter"; D'Ignazio & Klein, “What Gets Counted Counts”).

People who identify as non-binary have very valuable perspectives and experiences that could've enhanced the results of this study. 

To do full justice to the gender comparison in the CS field, including people who identify as non-binary is a must.  Excluding their experiences and perspectives is not only dangerous, but also detracts validity from the implicative message the data collectors attempt to give.
